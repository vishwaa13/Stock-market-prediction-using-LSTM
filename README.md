# Stock-market-prediction-using-LSTM
This is a simple model that predict the following 60 days of the stock market


Stock market is a stochaistic dataset therefore it is not possible to exactly predict the next move. But that said it is possible to predict if the stocks will increase or decrease the next day using the past patterns. This can be used to predict if the stocks will increase or decrease to an extent.

Here we use a recurrent neural network to use the past 60 days to predict the current days, stocks.
